# Top-Down-Shooter
Simple 1 v1 shooter against an AI

Controls:
- WASD/Arrows for movement
- Space/Mosue0 for shooting
- Esc to exit the game

Every round starts after the countdown. All projectiles are ricocheting from walls. AI is trying to reach to the player and shoots when player is on the fireline (calculating down to 3 ricochets from the walls). Every bullet hit is fatal. Falling out of the map is fatal. When one of the players dies, the game restarts and adds 1 point to another. Also the information about the last death writes under the score.
